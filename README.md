# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to find out more information about employees due to retire at Pewlett-Hackard. 
This was achieved by sketching an ERD, filtering through several spreadsheets, and establishing a database ready for queries in SQL.

##
The following query informs us how many people per job title are set to retire soon. (almost 100k people total!)
Looking at the data, we are made aware that an alarming amount of people are retiring from the company soon. 
Most notably the senior engineers and senior staff.

We also ran a search to see possible candidates for the mentorship program. Unfortunately, the number of eligible employees doesn't eclipse the amount of employees retiring. However fifty-five thousand isn't a bad start.

In an effort to stay ahead of the next wave, I propose that we do a query for the next year's eligble retirees so that we can either double down or pull back on our recruiting efforts. We could also do a query on all senior employees to put together a contact list. Perhaps they have some reccommendations for their own replacements.
