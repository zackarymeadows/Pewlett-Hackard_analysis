# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to find out more information about employees due to retire at Pewlett-Hackard. 
This was achieved by sketching an ERD, filtering through several spreadsheets, and establishing a database ready for queries in SQL.

Looking at the data, we are made aware that an alarming amount of people are retiring from the company soon. 
Most notably the senior engineers and senior staff. 

query one here. 

We also ran a search to see possible candidates for the mentorship program. Unfortunately, the number of eligible employees doesn't eclipse the amount of employees retiring. However fifty-five thousand isn't a bad start.
